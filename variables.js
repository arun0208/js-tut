//Variables in JavaScript

//There are Three types of variable declartion in JS
//var, let and const

// var name = "Arun";
// name = "RAM"
// console.log(name);

//var in js are least used because there is a scope of error because we can re-declare and re-initialize the variables

//let 

// let name = "Arun";
// let name = "Ram"     //Error -> Identifier 'name' has already been declared
// name = "RAM" // value will be updated
// console.log(name);


//in let we can update the value but we can't re declare it.

//const
//const is the most used varible declaration in JS

// const name = "Arun";
// name = "Ram";  //Error -> Assignment to constant variable.
// const name = "Ram"; //Error -> Identifier 'name' has already been declared
// const name; //Error -> Missing initializer in const declaration
// console.log(name);
